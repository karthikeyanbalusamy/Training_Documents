	- MLOps Introduction :::
	
		Github Account :
		
			https://github.com/
			
			
	- What is DevOps ???
	
	SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle :
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod
		
		- Monitor/Maintain 
		
		
	- Waterfall: 
		- It is Linear in fashion.
		- It strictly follows Top-Down Approach
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod
		
		- Monitor/Maintain 	
		
		
	Software Applications :
	
		- Desktop Applications
		- Web Applications
		- Mobile Applications
		- Embedded Applications
	
	
			
		- Desktop Applications	:::
			
			SuperMarket Billing System:
					--> Functions/Modules 
							- User Interface Design 
							- Inventory Mgmt 
							- Billing Mgmt
							- Supplier Mgmt 
							- Payment Mgmt 
								- Cash Payment 
								- Card Payment
							
										- Online Payment
										- UPI Payment 
							
					
	Core Project :
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		--> 12 Months 
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		--> 6th Month 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod
		
		- Monitor/Maintain


	Enhancement Project :
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		
		
	AGILE Methodologies :::
	
		- Desktop Applications	:::
			
			SuperMarket Billing System:
					--> Functions/Modules --> iterations  
							- User Interface Design 
							- Inventory Mgmt 
							- Billing Mgmt
							- Supplier Mgmt 
							- Payment Mgmt 
								- Cash Payment 
								- Card Payment		

							
										- Online Payment
										- UPI Payment 
										
	Iteration 1 : User Interface Design 
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod with proper manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		
		
	Iteration 2 : Inventory Mgmt
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod with proper manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		

	nth Iteration : Online Payment
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod with proper manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		
		
	Using AGILE Methodologies:
	
	 - We can Achieve :
	 
		- Continuous Development
		- Continuous Integration 
		- Continuous Testing 
		- Continuous Delivery
			- Used to perform Production release with manual approvals.
		
	 - We cannot Achieve :
	 
		- Continuous Deployment 	
			- Used to perform Production release without any manual approvals.
			
			
	- What is DevOps ???
	
	- DevOps :::::
	
		DevOps is a Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in more Automated Fashion.
		
			Continuous Delivery & Deployment:
			
				- Both Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment are used to release the changes from Non-Prod to Prod.
				
				Continuous Delivery:
				
					- Continuous Delivery Exepects Manual Approvals
					- We might experience the Application Down-time
	
					Eg: 
				
					Banking Domain :
					
						Online Banking / Credit Card Transaction
				
							Create a Production Release Window:
								4 - 6Hrs 
								
	
				Continuous Deployment:
				
					- Never Exepects Manual Approvals	
					- Deploy the changes to production without any down-time.

					Eg:
					
					- Amazon/Netflix/Facebook/Google ::
					
						
				
	
					
	- How to Implement DevOps :::
	
		- Identify the Teams involved in the process of SDLC :
		
			- DevOps Team 
				- Infra-Structure Management Team 
				- Application Development Team
				- Testing Team 
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- IT Security 
				
				
		- Environments :
		
			Non-Prod 									Prod Environments
			
				Dev Environment
				
				Test Environment
				
					QA 
					
					UAT 			================>		Production Servers - 1,2,3,4,5
	
		
		
		- Application Architecture :
		
			- Monolith Application Architecture:
			
				- It Tightly-Coupled Application Architecture
				- All the dependencies are tightly coupled 
				- With the we can achieve only Continuous Delivery.
				- We cannot achieve Continuous Deployment
			
			
			- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture: 
			
				- It is Loose-Coupled Application Architecture,
				- Each and every function is considered as Micro-Service.
				- With this we can achieve Continuous Deployment.

		- People
		- Strategy/Process 
		- Tools

	MLOps Lifecycle :
	
	MLOps Usecase :
	
	Versioning :
		
		Version Control System using Git :
		
		Git Demo :
		
	ML Project and Packaging ML Model 
	
	CICD Pipeline:
	
		- SCM_Checkout 	==> VCS ?
		- Application Build
		- Create Application Artifacts 
		- Test 
		- Deploy 
		
		
	How to Implement MLOps :::

	
		- Data Engineers		-> Prepare the Source Datasets 
		
		- Data Scientists 		->  Explore the datasets, analyse, check the feasibility of datasets 
									Perform the training, tuning, and evaluate the Model
		
		- ML Engineers 			-> Deploy the ML Models to prod -> MLOps Strageies CICD, define best practises
									Should have MLOps Knowledge
		
		- Business Stakeholders -> Bring business values using this ML Models 
		
		- Data Security/Governance Team  --> To Ensure data security & Governance, data privacy
		
		
	ML Model Use Case :
	
		ML Model for Product Reviews :
		
		E_Commerce Application Eg. www.amazon.com
		
		Product Review:
		
		
	CICD Pipeline:										
		- SCM_Checkout 	==> VCS ?							 
		- Application Build
		- Create Application Artifacts 
		- Test 
		- Deploy
